Fractals have always been interesting to me, both visually and mathematically.
I built a tool that allows users to explore the depths of different types of fractals.

Users can adjust color, max iterations, select predefined fractal sets, and even import their own formulae.
Zoom smoothing and rendering optimization included (it can still be slow).
